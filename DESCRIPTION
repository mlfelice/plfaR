Description: plfayer is a package designed for processing 13C-PLFA peak lists 
    generated from IonVantage software. Current functionality includes quality 
	control checks for duplicate peaks, missing standards, and viewing lipid 
	distribution. The primary (future) use is for converting raw peak lists 
	into lipid concentrations and biomarker relative abundance. In the future, 
	this package will also include calculation of 13C isotope ratios.
